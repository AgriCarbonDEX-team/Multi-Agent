Trong đó, đối với việc gửi dữ liệu từ cảm biến lên DT, chúng ta có thể sử dụng PSK (Preshared Secret Key) để xác thực và kiểm tra tính toàn vẹn thông qua HMAC vì DT nằm gần nguồn dữ liệu. Tuy nhiên, đối với việc gửi dữ liệu từ DT lên MVR, chúng ta không nên dùng PSK để xác thực và đảm bảo tính toàn vẹn vì khoảng cách xa khiến cho việc triển khai PSK trở nên khó khăn hơn khi muốn mở rộng hệ thống và cập nhật  khóa. Do đó, chúng ta sẽ sử dụng hệ mã hóa khóa công khai và chữ kí số. Vì dữ liệu được gửi từ DT lên MVR theo thời gian thực nên chúng ta cần xác thực DT và đồng thuận khóa phiên SSK (Session Key) trước rồi dùng SSK đó để đảm bảo tính toàn vẹn của dữ liệu. Việc xác thực DT, MVR và các bên liên quan, chúng tôi không dùng chứng chỉ X.509 với TLS mà tận dụng DID đã trình bày, cụ thể là Ethr DID.
